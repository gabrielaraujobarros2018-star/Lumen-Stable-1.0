# Build planning

As for now, **February 15 of 2026**, Here's my Plans for Lumen Stable 1.0:

**Phase**: After *Developer Preview* phase.
**Package Name**: it can be a 'lumen_stable_1.0' package name wrapped in ZIP, .tar.gz, TAR, or .tar.bz2.
**Arrival**: Still, i don't know. It could arrive in late 2026 or Mid-2027 With rigorous testing in Emulators.
**Compilation**: Compiling Java, C, C++, Python, rust, and SQL code (Only) if no more programming languages are added. Still, it'll take time due to compile errors.
**Stability**: The OS **Will** be Stable enough to be called "Stable" but not to the Stability Point of Android or iOS. But rigorous testing will help in stability.
**Competition**: the OS Won't start Competing with Android or iOS because it was made to avoid that.

And that's the info i could share.
