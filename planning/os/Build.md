# Build planning

As for now, **February 15 of 2026**, Here's my Plans for Lumen Stable 1.0:

**Phase**: After *Developer Preview* phase.
**Package Name**: it can be a 'lumen_stable_1.0' package name wrapped in ZIP, .tar.gz, TAR, or .tar.bz2.
**Arrival**: Still, i don't know. It could arrive in late 2026 or Mid-2027 With rigorous testing in Emulators.
**Compilation**: Compiling Java, C, C++, Python, rust, and SQL code (Only) if no more programming languages are added. Still, it'll take time due to compile errors.
**Stability**: The OS **Will** be Stable enough to be called "Stable" but not to the Stability Point of Android or iOS. But rigorous testing will help in stability.
**Competition**: the OS Won't start Competing with Android or iOS because it was made to avoid that.

And that's the info i could share.

## Build roadmap

IMPORTANT WARNING

From M3 Snapshot 2 and up, File count and Source size increased dramatically due to Extracted source codes (Libxml, linux kernel, wayland, etc.) to Prepare for Several Modifications. Lumen release frequency will be Significantly slowed down (from daily snapshots to Monthly complete builds + 2 day Breaks as planned) because Lumen exploded in size from 500mb to 900MB+ and i can't upload daily 900mb builds anymore due to cloud storage limits.

But there's an advantage on monthly builds: Less packaging work, More complete builds compared to <1 month builds, and breaks are possible.

Plot twist: on 2027, Lumen Stable 1.0 will arrive. And on 2027/2028, Updates will go from Monthly to Yearly

i usually upload the M3 snapshots (Like i uploaded the M3 snapshot 2 via .tar.gz)

i can't upload literal 65000+ files extracted on MEGA, i have to compact them into .tar.gz, because if i upload extracted, it'll severely impact my MEGA account

Heads-up: M3 Snapshot 2 have 65000+ files, so uploading that ammount is impossible to me. i Can upload its source code extracted, but only some lightweight modules under 4mb

With 'M3 -> M5 -> M8 -> Alphis V1 -> Alphis V2 -> Alphis V3 -> Alphis V4 -> Alphis V5 -> Alphis V6 -> DP-1 -> DP-5 -> DP-8 -> DP-11 -> Stable 1.0' Roadmap, We can reach a 14-month Roadmap to Stable 1.0, which by calculating (M3 Started in February 2026, Adding 14 months make Stable 1.0 land in April of 2027), Makes the Stable 1.0 build land on April of the following year if Stable 1.0 is counted as a Monthly build too.
