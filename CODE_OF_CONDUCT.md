## Purpose
Lumen Stable 1.0 is a PC-focused Linux-based operating system project welcoming contributors worldwide. We strive for a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or religion.

## Expected Behavior
- Be respectful and kind in all interactions.
- Assume good intent and value others' ideas.
- Use welcoming, inclusive language.
- Participate constructively, focusing on technical merit.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks.
- Offensive comments based on identity or background.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Disruptive behavior like spamming or flame wars.
- Publishing private info without consent (doxxing).

## Reporting Guidelines
If you witness or experience violations:
- Report to project maintainers via GitHub issues or email (contact@lumen-os.org).
- Provide details like screenshots, usernames, and timestamps.
All reports will be reviewed confidentially and promptly.

## Enforcement
- First violation: Warning and request to stop.
- Repeated or severe: Temporary or permanent ban from project spaces.
- Maintainers enforce fairly; appeals go to project leads.

We follow the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) as a base.
